This repo is an introduction to using a grid in Angular and will allow you to familiarize yourself with the groundwork for using the ag-grid, a 508 compliant grid for manipulating data.

This initial workup has been kept to a minimum to ensure ease of use and facilitating the users' grasp of the basic concepts of how the grid can be used.  For a more realistic experience an external api is used.

The overall display is responsive down to tablet sized displays.   Once you are familiar with the workings of the resizing take time to test your skills on ensuring the desired alignment is maintained after resizing.

Reordering the column display takes place by clicking on the column header.

Filtering takes place by clicking on the hamburger in the right corner of the column header.  As you begin typing the filtering (and/or) will be activated.
Removing any typed characters will return the display back to its original state.

Multiple selections can be effected by clicking on the checkbox on the left side of the screen.  Clicking on the <Get Selected Rows> at the bottom left will  display the information of the selected rows.   This particular function can be useful for passing data back to the server when needed or to an external application.

 As of now only the ID and User columns have drag enabled to limit which field(s) can be dragged.  Left mouse click on the small icon to the left of the column.   Row managing takes place during the drag.
 
 Resizing of the columns has been enabled. 

 Inline editing is enabled with a double click
